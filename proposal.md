# Progress Report

> If the grant is still active, provide a short summary of progress towards the
> deliverables (maximum of 250 words).

Over the period of the currently active grant, we believe we have successfully
achieved our targets:

- Feature releases made at a regular 2-per-year schedule, typically
  with 3 bugfix releases between them
- Initial response to all issues / new PRs within a week
- Resolve majority of new issues / PRs within 1 month
- Resolve 75 issues / quarter
- Merge or close 75 PRs / quarter

We have implemented several larger projects, including changing build systems
to Meson, overhauling our website, and moving compiled extensions to pybind11.
We identified several medium size projects, such as adding a new GTK4 backend
(with high DPI support), completing font fallback work started by our Google
Summer of Code student, and writing our mission statement.  At this time, two
medium-size projects -- a high DPI refactor, and knockout group-based
collection drawing -- have been started and are in progress.

Python 3.12 exposed a fatal, but hidden, bug on macOS.  In part due to this
active grant, we were able to timely address this issue with bugfix releases in
both the current and previous feature releases within two weeks.

As community outreach, we ran sprints at Grace Hopper Day Celebration (2022,
2023), SciPy (2022, 2023), PyData NYC (2023), and PyData Global (2023).  These
sprints exposed new contributors, including those from under represented
groups, to contributing to Matplotlib specifically and open source in general.

We worked with Melissa MendonÃ§a (as the Contributor Experience Lead), supported
by CZI [1].

Python Ecosystem.


# Proposal Summary

> Provide a short summary of the application (maximum of 500 words)
> (auto-filled from LOI; update if needed)

Matplotlib is the foundational data visualization library for the Scientific
Python Ecosystem, with over a million users, including researchers in
bio-medical imaging, microscopy, and genomics.  Matplotlib is used by
researchers across the entire scientific workflow from initial data exploration
and visualization, to evaluating the output of AI/ML models, to publishing
finalized figures.

For the past 20 years Matplotlib has been maintained by a vibrant, primarily
volunteer, community.  However we have grown too big and widely used to
continue on solely volunteer effort.  For the past 42 months CZI EOSS support
for developers has had a positive effect on the project by complementing and
enabling, not replacing, volunteer work.  We propose to continue this effort.

The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of the
library and its community. Maintenance covers a wide range of tasks including
triaging and fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, tagging and building
releases, keeping the continuous integration services running, and mentoring
new contributors.  These tasks are essential for the project's health; though
each individually is small, they are frequently time critical and sometimes
tedious.  It is unfair and impractical to rely solely on volunteers to
accomplish such tasks.

A major improvement enabled by supported developers has been our transition to
a regular release schedule.  Currently, feature releases are now made at a
regular 2-per-year schedule, typically with 3 bugfix releases between them.
This regularity, roughly doubling our previous average rate, allows downstream
projects and users to rapidly benefit from ongoing improvements in Matplotlib.

In addition to on-going and routine maintenance, there are substantial but
incremental enhancements to Matplotlib that require long blocks of dedicated
effort to implement.  Without supported developers, such projects can drag out
for months to years or stall altogether.  Examples include fixing long-standing
rendering and performance issues, overhauling build systems to match the
changing Python ecosystem, homogenizing and smoothing the API, and new
user-facing functionality.  Projects to be pursued with the funding requested
here will be selected in consultation with downstream biomedical libraries.

Finally, supported developers improve the management of the project.  We now
have the time and bandwidth to make strategic decisions about the direction of
the project to ensure the long term health and viability of Matplotlib.  An
important part of project management is community management: fostering,
diversifying, and growing our community.  Supported developers are able to
perform outreach: attending conferences, mentoring sprints, or teaching
tutorials.  We must ensure that our community is open and welcoming to everyone
who wants to join, with opportunities to contribute in a spectrum of roles as
their interests and skills develop.

We propose to continue full support (1 FTE) for Elliott Sales de Andrade and
partial support (.15 FTE) for Thomas Caswell.  The effort will be split with
approximately .7 FTE for maintenance, .25 FTE for medium sized enhancements,
and .2 FTE for community and project management.


# work Plan

> A description of the proposed work for which funding is being requested,
> including resources the applicants will provide that are not part of the
> requested funding. For software development-related work (e.g., engineering,
> product design, user research), specify how the work fits into the existing

> target audience, and expected outcomes (maximum of 750 words)

The proposed work can be broadly classified into three parts:

- on-going and routine maintenance of Matplotlib;
- implementation of several mid-sized features;
- community and project management.

These tasks underpin the long term health of the library but are ill-suited to
be accomplished solely with volunteer effort.

The primary component of the proposed work is the continued maintenance of
Matplotlib.  Maintenance covers a wide range of tasks including triaging and
fixing bugs, reviewing Pull Requests, tagging and building releases, and
keeping the continuous integration services running.  These tasks are essential
for the project's health; though each individually is small, they are
frequently time critical and tedious.  It is unfair and impractical to rely
solely on volunteers to accomplish such tasks.

For the past 42 months CZI EOSS support for developers has had a positive
effect on the project by complementing and enabling, not replacing, volunteer
work.  We propose to continue this effort.  The dedicated support has allowed
us to promptly fix critical bugs -- including a Python version specific
segfault in a new CPython release -- and extremely subtle bugs, such as a bug
in generating incorrect color palette in PDF output.

In addition to routine maintenance there are substantial improvements to the
library that can require concentrated effort.  We propose to focus on three
large projects: generalizing and improving the performance of the Axis ticking
system, modernizing the font handling code to support variable fonts and
complex text rendering (required for languages such as Arabic, Bengali, and
Hebrew), and to overhaul how we manage GUI windows.  In addition we will
identify five medium-sized projects.

The tick location and formatting machinery in Matplotlib is flexible, but this
flexibility comes at a performance cost, architecturally prevents hierarchical
labeling, and reduces API usability by making seemingly simple tasks extremely
complex.  While the work to design the new API is significant, our primary
concern will be to complete this work while minimizing the impact on existing
users.  Because tick labeling is so fundamental to plotting even small changes
to the API will have significant impact on our users.  Although we have had
discussion about these issues since at least 2015 [1,2], it has been
intractable with volunteer effort.

Matplotlib currently does not support complex shaping, including bidirectional
text, context sensitive shaping, and ordering, required to correctly render
some non-Latin scripts including Arabic, Devanagari, and Hebrew.  Further,
Matplotlib does not support modern font formats, color fonts, or OpenType font
variations.  There is an existing external implementation of this support that
can be adapted for the main library.  This is a low risk project that will
allow users to plot in their native languages and leverage modern fonts.

The Matplotlib pyplot module provides bindings to several UI toolkits, along
with stateful management of the figure life-cycle.  These toolkit windows and
figures are intertwined in ways that can be unintuitive to users, and contrary
to expectations set by newer notebook-based development styles.  We have
produced a prototype that overhauls this UI management and allows more
independent control of the figure life-cycle compared to its UI appearance, and
we propose to integrate this prototype into the main library.

We have identified two barriers to new contributors to Matplotlib: difficulty
in finding an good issue and delays in the review process.  To address the
first, we will continue to identify and roadmap how to implement "good first
issues".  By labeling the issues in the GitHub UI they are discoverable and the
roadmap provides context and guidance to someone new to the library.  Secondly,
we will prioritize reviewing PRs from new contributors to help them be merged
in a timely manner.  By being responsive to new contributor's PRs we will
improve their contributing experience and in turn increase the rate at which
they open subsequent PRs to become a regular contributor.

We propose to continue full support (1 FTE) for Elliott Sales de Andrade and
partial support (.08 FTE) for Thomas Caswell along with travel and equipment
support for 2 years.  The effort will be split with approximately .73 FTE for
maintenance, .25 FTE for medium sized enhancements, and .1 FTE for community
and project management.  We also propose to fund Code of Conduct incident
response training.

# Milestones and Deliverables

> List expected milestones and deliverables, and their expected timeline. Be
> specific and include where possible any goals for metrics the software

Quantitatively evaluating maintenance work can be tricky---some Issues or PRs
take minutes to review while others can take days to weeks of effort---but we
believe that there is value in looking at the throughput of issues and PRs
supported by the grant.  The total number of open issues and PRs is dependent
on both how many come in and the amount of work done by volunteers.  We will
aim to hit the following metrics:

- Initial response to all issues / new PRs within a week
- Resolve majority of new issues / PRs within 1 month
- Resolve 75 issues / quarter
- Merge or close 75 PRs / quarter

We have proposed three large scale projects above:

 - overhauling the axis ticking and labeling system
 - modernizing font and language support
 - simplifying integration with GUI toolkits

that will be merged to the main branch by the end of the grant period.  In
addition we will aim to complete 5 mid-sized projects of smaller scope.  The
exact projects will be determined in collaboration with the community and
downstream bio libraries.

We will target a feature releases (3.N.0) every 6 months with 2-3 patch
releases (3.N.X) between feature releases.

As mentioned above, Matplotlib is involved in on-going and proposed work on
improving diversity in our community.  We will run at least two conference
sprints per year to introduce a broad population to contributing to Matplotlib.

Matplotlib is the most widely used and de-facto standard visualization library
in Python (over 1M monthly users) and is a mature library (20+ years old) with
over 1,500 individual code contributors.  In addition to being directly used by
scientists, it is a core dependency of libraries and applications that
implement domain-specific visualizations.  To aid users in discovering these
extensions we maintain a lightly curated list of third-party extensions [1] and
have been assigned a Trove classifier on PyPI [2] that allows downstream
developers to self-identify as Matplotlib extensions.

Given the centrality of visualization to data analysis across all domains, no
single tool can satisfy all needs.  There are a range of tools not built on
Matplotlib (see [3] for a long but not exhaustive list) that target use cases
that Matplotlib is not well suited for.  Outside of the Python ecosystem, a
wide range of biomedical visualization libraries and applications exist in R or
Java. Proprietary solutions such as MATLAB or Tableau may also be used in
various scientific fields.

Matplotib's ubiquity and maturity provide users with a stable and easily
understood tool on which to build both bespoke and reproducible visualizations.
Its availability in the Python ecosystem allows for direct integration with
data processing and modelling tools in a familiar environment.

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

> Advancing DEI is a core value for this program, and we are requesting
> information on your efforts in this area. Describe any efforts the software
> project(s) named in this proposal have undertaken to increase diversity,
> equity, and inclusion with respect to their contributors and audience. Please
> see examples from applications funded in previous cycles (maximum of 250
> words)

Matplotlib is committed to being an open and welcoming project.  We believe
that transparency and explicitness of process and in communication are key to
building an inclusive, equitable, and diverse project.  In our effort to be
welcoming, we have worked at being more explicit about our norms and values and
how the project operates.

We have continued two initiatives to lower the barrier of entry for individuals
to get involved in developing Matplotlib: a triage role in the project and an
"incubator" channel on our gitter.  In addition we now have open monthly new
contributor meetings to assist with the on boarding process.

It is critical that all contributors, independent of experience level both in
general and with the project, feel safe to make mistakes and learn in our
community.  We strive to embody these values in our interactions on GitHub, our
mailing list and community discussion forum (discourse), and in our social
media.  We hope that these practices will empower and encourage people from
varied backgrounds and experiences to participate in Matplotlib.
